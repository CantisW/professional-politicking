# DRAFT

This is a draft of the concept! Please please make suggestions or feedback!!

Rules are not at all finalized.

# LOGISTICS

Basically, this event will need just a few key volunteers:

| Role                     | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Debate Moderator         | Ask the candidates up to three questions (literally whatever), and moderate audience questions                                                               |
| Electoral Poll Volunteer | Help work the polls by running the ballot station and counting ballots                                                                                       |
| Additional               | We probably won't need more than this, but additional volunteers can contribute to the chaos, help "certify" the election, whatnot. Just make this engaging. |

This is an extremely low budget event, where we only need ballots (pieces of paper), pencils, and a ballot box (we can craft this out of anything the day before).

# CONCEPT

Essentially, students will crowd into the MPR and be asked whether they'd like to run for president. Choose a couple people at random (five or so?) then ask for their names (to put into the script)

Run this script. It will handle the whole pseudo-randomness fun. Then, the actual game will start after a few minutes of the presidental candidates musing over their platform.

Debates should be no more than 10 minutes? Then, the audience will have 5-10 minutes to ask directed questions to the candidates.

After that, voting commences. Each person should line up at the polling station (stairs) and submit a ballot. Ballots will be counted, and the election will be certified.

The winning candidate makes a no-more-than-three-minute-long victory speech.

This should be a big-energy, fast-paced game. Just keep this up for the scheduled...two hours?

# CONTRIBUTING

If you are stalking this repo and want to contribute (even if you don't want to volunteer), **pleaaaaseee** add platforms, parties, and nation names. Make a PR and I'll probably approve it.
